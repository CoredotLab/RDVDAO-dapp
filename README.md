## Overview
*"Vireo"* is Latin for "green". Vireo is simply Web3.0 "GreenPeace". Vireo is a project that started with the belief that blockchain technology can help the environment. 

We thought that the web3.0 POS validator activity would be a clue to sustainability. We set up a treasury with the yield from the validator and completed the structure by letting the DAO decide how to use the treasury for environmental activities.

In addition, DAO users can check their environmental impact in a visualized form and enjoy more environmental activities by obtaining VireoX creatures (Dynamic NFTs) that evolve in proportion to the amount of staking and the period of time.


## Background
In 2023, the world was hit by an unprecedented climate crisis. As we were in the blockchain industry, we were inspired to start using blockchain to heal environmental problems. 

## Why Validators?
-   **Long-Term Commitment**: Solving environmental issues isn't a quick fix; it requires sustained attention and investment.

-   **The Web3.0 Solution**: ***Vireo*** enables donors to preserve their principal amount, using only the generated interest  
    for environmental causes.


## Current Scale of Staking
-  60+ POS staking available chains.
- Staking market cap is over 9 billion $

## How It Works

**1. Delegated Staking**  
smart contracts transparently direct generated interest into an environmental treasury.  
A real-time dashboard allows users to track how much is staked and accrued in the treasury.

**2. Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)**  
Stakers are granted DAO memberships that allow them voting rights on how the treasury is utilized.  
DAO members can propose and vote on environmental initiatives.

**3. Dynamic NFTs (D-NFT)**  
Stakers receive D-NFTs as proof of membership.  
These D-NFTs evolve based on the amount and duration of the stake, and they can grant additional voting power.
